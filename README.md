Bayesian optimization of WOMBAT model parameters using surrogate Gaussian Process Regression model

Implementing Gaussian process regression-based Bayesian optimization (G-BO) using the emcee package (https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

For more information about the implementation of G-BO, please refer to the paper - [Gaussian process regression-based Bayesian optimization (G-BO) of model parameters - a WRF model case study of southeast Australia heat extremes](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL111074).
